## Bootcamp Week 10 Challenge
This week's challenge was to write a Node.js command-line application to generate a HTML webpage with employee information for a software engineering company. The requirements were the following:

1. Use the Inquirer package.
2. Write unit tests, run them via Jest, and confirm they all pass.
3. Accept user input from the command line to gather employee information.
4. Start off getting team manager info, and then go through prompts to add engineers or interns until the team is complete.
5. Use an employee class with properties that each employee has in common, and then use specific classes (manager, engineer, and intern) to extend the employee class.
6. When the webpage is generated, ensure the email and Github links are clickable.
